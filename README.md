# Block.js
Simple, in-progress, open-source JS framework with no intention of becoming 
popular because the last thing we need is another JS framework. 

## Goal
To create a simplistic, versatile, and functional framework that will be used as an example for how a framework should be made. 

## Contributing
Contributing is supported and encouraged. To contribute just open an issue or pull request. 

### Requirements
- Without a readable environment people wont contribute. Without an efficient framework people wont use it. Prioritize both while considering the downside of each and balancing it out. 

## Features
- [x] Components
- [ ] Props
- [ ] Data templating
- [ ] Extensions (Routing, State Management, etc...)
